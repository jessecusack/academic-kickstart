I'm a physical oceanographer currently working as a postdoc at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I research small to mesoscale scale physical processes in the ocean such as turbulence, flow over topography, internal waves and wave-eddy interactions. I am interested in the role such processes play in the Earth's climate.
