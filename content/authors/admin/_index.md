# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I study ocean physics over a range of length scales from turbulence (millimeters) to mesoscale eddies (hundreds of kilometers). I am particularly interested in understanding how the ocean melts glaciers and how currents interact with topography to generate mixing.

**I am looking for PhD students, especially those interested in glacier - ocean interactions. Please contact me for more information.**

I am an [Assistant Professor in Physical Oceanography at Oregon State University](https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/people/jesse-cusack). I am interested in ocean physics over length scales from turbulence (millimeters) to mesoscale eddies (hundreds of kilometers). Questions that motivate me include: _"how do currents influence ice melt at glaicers?"_, _"how is mixing generated when currents hit topography?"_, and _"how much energy is exchanged between eddies and internal waves?"_. My approach combines analysis of high resolution in situ observations with numerical simulations. I practice open science by making my analysis and software [available online](https://github.com/jessecusack).
