# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at Rutgers University. I study small to mesoscale ocean processes such as turbulence, flows over topography, internal waves and eddies. I am interested in the role such processes play in Earth's climate.

I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at Rutgers University. I study small to mesoscale ocean processes such as turbulence, flows over topography, internal waves and eddies. I am interested in the role such processes play in Earth's climate. My approach combines analysis of high resolution in situ observations with numerical simulations. I practice open science by making analysis and software [available online](https://github.com/jessecusack).
